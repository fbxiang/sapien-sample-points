    Sample the surface of a mesh, returning the specified

    mesh : trimesh.Trimesh
      Geometry to sample the surface of
    count : int
      Number of points to return
    face_weight : None or len(mesh.faces) float
      Weight faces by a factor other than face area.
      If None will be the same as face_weight=mesh.area
    sample_color : bool
      Option to calculate the color of the sampled points.
      Default is False.
    seed : None or int
      If passed as an integer will provide deterministic results
      otherwise pulls the seed from operating system entropy.

    Returns
    ---------
    samples : (count, 3) float
      Points in space on the surface of mesh
    face_index : (count,) int
      Indices of faces for each sampled point
    colors : (count, 4) float
      Colors of each sampled point
      Returns only when the sample_color is True

    Sample the surface of a mesh, returning samples which are
    VERY approximately evenly spaced. This is accomplished by
    sampling and then rejecting pairs that are too close together.

    fewer points than requested (i.e. n < count). If this is the
